# Jay M. Anderson's (1974) model of Hardin's "Tragedy of the Commons" 

In 1974, Jay M. Anderson's published a DYNAMO model of Hardin's (1968) "Tragedy of the Commons" in *Science*. "Tragedy of the Commons" describes a system archetype (Senge, 1990) where common pool resources (e.g., fisheries, forests, water, grazing land) collapse as a result of a collective action failure where individual actors are incentivized to maximize their extraction of a resource to improve productivity. While originally referring to natural resources, the notion of common pool resources also extends to organizations including universities. For example, common pool resources in a department include physical space, copiers, and preaward grant support. In human services, commons include primary care providers, mental health providers, physical therapists, K-12 teachers, diagnostics, etc. The key feature of common pool resources is that they are both nonexcludeable and rivalrous. Nonexcludable means that it is difficult to exclude people from accessing the resources. Rvialrous means that one person's use takes away from another person's use.

Hardin's model was provocative and argued that people, left to their own devices, cannot avoid the "Tragedgy of the Commons" and hence need some outside control to avoid the collapse, e.g., through markets or government. In *Managing the Commons*, Victor and Elinor Ostrom argued that this was too stark of a view and that communities are, in fact, quite capable of developing informal institutional arrangements for effectively and sustainably managing the commons. This set in motion a program of research on how this happens, which eventually resulted in Elinor Ostrom being the first woman to get the Noble Prize in Economics. 

Anderson's 1974 version of "Tragedy of the Commons" appears in Hardin and Baden's 1977 *Managing the Commons*, which is a summary of papers presented at a meeting that Victor and Elinor Ostrom attended. Hence, Elinor Ostrom was familiar with system dynamics as far back as 1977. The model is still referred today. Most recently, Langarudi et al (2021) used the model as a basis for an analysis of measuring and reporting published in *System Dynamics Review*.
